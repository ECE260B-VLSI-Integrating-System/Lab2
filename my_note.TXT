tcl: one command script
rtl: rtl-level verilog code

run_dc.tcl: this file do the all the job

dc_shell just open a platform we use.

sdc and tcl the command script is similar, but it is related to the verilog file.
verilog file is divide into two aspect, structural model, and behavior model

Register-transfer level is basically structual model
